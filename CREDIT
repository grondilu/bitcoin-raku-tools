Thanks a lot to Satoshi Nakamoto for what he has accomplished.

Thanks to other bitcoin developpers, especially Gavin Andersen and ThomasV.

Thanks to Larry Wall for having designed Perl, such a great programming language.

Thanks a lot to the Perl6/Rakudo developpers.  Perl6 is an amazing language and
these guys in the rakudo team definitely kick asses.   Keep on the good work,
guys!

More generally, thanks so much to the FOSS community as whole, for freeing culture
and technological knowledge.
