libbitcoin-perl6, an attempt to implement the bitcoin protocol in Perl6.

Bitcoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer electronic currency.  It was
developped in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto in C++.

This library is a set of bitcoin-related functions in Perl6, the sixth version
of the Perl programming language.

The (very) long term objective is to implement a fully operational bitcoin node
and client.  Hopefully the code will be useful much before this goal is
achieved, for instance for creating bitcoin addresses or analysing the block
chain.
